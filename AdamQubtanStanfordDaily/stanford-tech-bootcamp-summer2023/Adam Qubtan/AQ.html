    <h3 style="font-family: cursive;">These are all my favorite things, my favorite kinds of places are places that are flat and have a lot of grass. Places like these are nice during a road trip. My favorite food is mac and cheese with popcorn chicken or ground beef. The combination of meat and cheese is very delicious and satisfying to eat. My favorite drink is orange juice. My favorite sport to play during the summer is golf. One day I will get a hole in one. My favorite color is green. It is a natural and calming color to see. My favorite subject is math. You can use math from survival skills to making fun games. My favorite animal is a lion. A lion is the king of the jungle(note he is actually the king of the safari grasslands). My favorite type of music is classic piano music. And my favorite language in computer science is html.</h3>
